# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:

**Objective**: Populate this documentation using the existing codebase as the source of truth, strictly adhering to the defined structure.

-   **Fact-Based Population**:
    -   Fill in all sections using *only* known information derived directly from the codebase logic and configuration.
    -   Verify all claims against the current implementation.

-   **Placeholder Protocol**:
    -   If information is missing, unclear, or not yet implemented, you **MUST** leave a clearly marked placeholder.
    -   Format: `[MISSING: Description of missing info]` or `[TODO: Action item]`.
    -   *Do not* guess or fabricate details to fill space.

-   **Structural Integrity**:
    -   This markdown structure is **MANDATORY**.
    -   Do not alter, reorder, or remove headings unless explicitly instructed.
    -   Preserve the hierarchy of information.

-   **Formatting Consistency**:
    -   Treat any pre-existing content in this document as a style guide.
    -   Mimic the tone, list style (bullets vs. numbers), and data formatting (e.g., table columns) of existing examples.
